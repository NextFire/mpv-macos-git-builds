# mpv-macos-git-builds

**The latest version is available [here](https://github.com/NextFire/mpv-macos-git-builds/releases/latest).**

This repository provides unofficial git desktop builds of [mpv-player/mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv) for macOS.

Compiled with stable version of `ffmpeg`.

## Homebrew tap

You can `brew tap nextfire/tap` ([repo](https://github.com/NextFire/homebrew-tap)) then install the git build with `brew install --cask mpv-git`.

The tap is automatically updated at each release so you can use `brew upgrade` to update mpv.
